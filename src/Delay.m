function [ out ] = Delay( in, depth, delay, feedback, fs)
%DELAY Summary of this function goes here
%
% VARIÁVEIS:
%   IN - input guitar audio vector
%   DEPTH - 0 (no delay sig added) to 1 (equal amplitude delay signal)
%   DELAY - delay time from 0.1 msec (0.0001 sec) to 8 sec (in seconds)
%   FEEDBACK - feedback gain - amplitude of delayed signal to be fedback
%            - should be 0 < f < 1

    % first delay by padding beginning with proper # zeros
    % then zero pad the end of the delayed signal for the rest of the delays
    % that come from feedback
    % below, in is also padded with the same # zeros to handle longer delay
    % times
